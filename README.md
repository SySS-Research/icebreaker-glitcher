# iCEBreaker Glitcher

The iCEBreaker Glitcher is a simple voltage glitcher for an iCEBreaker FPGA board.

This glitcher is based on and inspired by glitcher implementations by
Dmitry Nedospasov (@nedos) from [Toothless Consulting](https://toothless.co/)
and Grazfather (@Grazfather).

The iCEBreaker Glitcher exemplarily demonstrates how the code read protection (CRP) of
NXP LPC-family microcontrollers can be bypassed as presented by Chris
Gerlinsky (@akacastor) in his talk [Breaking Code Read Protection on the NXP LPC-family Microcontrollers](Breaking Code Read Protection on the NXP LPC-family Microcontrollers)
at REcon Brussles 2017.

## Hardware Requirements

- [iCEBreaker FPGA Board](https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/icebreaker-fpga)
- Analog switch, for instance [MAX4619](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/analog-switches-multiplexers/MAX4619.html)
- Power supply (2 externally supplied voltages required), for instance [Rigol DP832](https://www.rigolna.com/products/dc-power-loads/dp800/)

## Software Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [pylibftdi](https://pypi.org/project/pylibftdi/)
- [sty](https://pypi.org/project/sty/)
- [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)
- [nextpnr-ice40](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr)
- [Project IceStorm Tools](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm)

## Test Setup

The following two images show a working test setup for the iCEBreaker Glitcher.

## Demo

This demo video exemplarily shows how the code read protection (CRP) of an [NXP LPC1343 chip](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10375.pdf) can be bypassed by using a voltage glitching attack in order to dump the flash memory containing the firmware.

In this proof-of-concept video, the [iCEstick Glitcher](https://github.com/SySS-Research/icestick-glitcher) was used, which works in the same way as the iCEBreaker glitcher.
